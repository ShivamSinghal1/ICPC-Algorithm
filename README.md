# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING ALGORITHMS
The purpose of this repository is to get all the Algorithms required for Competitive Programming at one place. This will be very helpful.

#### If you wish to contribute, please refer to [the contributor guidelines](https://github.com/ShivamSinghal1/Competitive-Programming-Algorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Add a Competitive Programming Algorithm other than the mentioned in the repository. 
- Please do not copy from the internet and then paste it here. Try to implement on your own. 
- Try to generalize the Algorithm.
- The purpose is to learn something from this. 
- If you implement some algorithm from this repository and found some issue , Raise issue and it will be solved ASAP.

#### If you want to Practice then visit (https://codedigger.tech) and practice topicwise competitive problems from competitive sites Codeforces , SPOJ , Codechef and UVa.

## Mathematics_Algo 
  1) calculate_Factor :- To Calculate Factor of any number n, returns set loaded with all factors of n.
  2) gcd_Extended :- To calculate gcd with Extended Euclidean ax+by=gcd(a,b).
  3) isPrime :- To check whether a number is Prime or Not.
  4) modInverse :- To calculate modInverse of any number, (a * modInverse of a)% m = 1.
  5) nCr with Mod :- Returns (nCr)%m.
  6) nCr without Mod :- Return (nCr).
  7) power with Mod :- (n^p)%m.
  8) power without Mod :- (x^y).
  9) pre_calculate_factorial :- To pre calculate factorial and there inverse and loaded in the array.
  10) prime_factor :- Generate prime factors of any number n.
  11) seive :- Return vector with loaded prime numbers. Fill array with smallest prime factor that divides that number. Example:- for a[1] = 0, a[2] or for prime number = 1, for composite a[6] = 2.
  12) sum of GP :- Calculate sum of Geometric Progression of series (1 + r + r^2 +....+ r^(n-2) ) % m.
  13) totient :- Total numbers from 1 to N whose gcd with N is 1.
  14) fibonacciNumber(n) :- Returns the nth Fibonacci Number in constant time.
  15)Spiral Search in 2d array (C++ code)
  16) Computes the last digit of fibonacci square series F0^2 + F1^2 + · · · + Fn^2 in constant time.
